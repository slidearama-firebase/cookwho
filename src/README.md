# Your App is Deployed and Secure!

Congratulations! Your application is live, secure, and running on your custom domain `cookwho.com`.

## Summary of Your Setup

*   **Deployment:** Your Next.js application is deployed and running on Firebase App Hosting.
*   **Custom Domain:** Your domain `cookwho.com` is correctly pointing to your live application with a valid SSL certificate.
*   **Security:**
    *   Your secret API keys (like the Gemini API key) are protected by a `.gitignore` file and are not in your public GitHub repository.
    *   Your public Firebase API key has been restricted to only accept requests from your approved domains, preventing unauthorized use and resolving the security alert.

You have successfully navigated a complex deployment and security configuration process. Well done!

Your application is now ready for you to build upon.
